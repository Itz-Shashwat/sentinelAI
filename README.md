ðŸ”¥ Sentinel AI: GAN-Powered Network Decoy Injection
Sentinel AI is a cybersecurity project that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate realistic decoy network traffic. The system detects outgoing network packets and injects fake but convincing packets into the network to mislead potential attackers and enhance security.

ðŸš€ Key Features:
âœ… GAN-Generated Decoy Data â€“ Creates synthetic network traffic that mimics real packets.
âœ… Packet Injection System â€“ Injects decoy packets dynamically when real traffic is detected.
âœ… Wireshark-Based Data Collection â€“ Uses real network traffic as training data.
âœ… TensorFlow/Keras GAN Model â€“ Trains a deep learning model to generate realistic decoy data.
âœ… Network Obfuscation â€“ Confuses attackers by blending real and fake traffic.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:
Python (Packet manipulation & GAN training)
Scapy (Packet injection & network monitoring)
Wireshark (Traffic capture for dataset generation)
TensorFlow/Keras (GAN model training)
This project enhances network security by creating an AI-powered deception strategy, making reconnaissance attacks ineffective by feeding attackers false data.
