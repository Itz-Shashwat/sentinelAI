1. Start the Injector Program First
The injector program needs to listen for traffic and generate decoy packets.
Run it in the terminal:
bash
Copy code
sudo python3 decoy_injector.py
2. Simulate Real Traffic Using Commands
Open another terminal window and run the following commands:

Ping Command:

bash
Copy code
ping -c 4 google.com
Curl Command:

bash
Copy code
curl https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1
3. Monitor Decoy Packets
The injector program (decoy_injector.py) should detect real traffic (from ping and curl) and inject decoy packets based on the configurations from your CSV file.
If the program writes logs or outputs decoy packet data, you should see it in the terminal where the injector is running.
4. (Optional) Verify Traffic
Use Wireshark or your own monitoring program to verify:
Outgoing traffic includes both real and decoy packets.
Confirm the structure and details of synthetic packets.
